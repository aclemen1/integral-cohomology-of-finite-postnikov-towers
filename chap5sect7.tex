\section{Conclusion and conjectures}

The purpose of this last section is to summarize our contribution to the investigation of the relationships between homotopy and homology exponents. 

\medskip
First, we have seen in Chapter \ref{chapter:2} that the Eilenberg-MacLane spaces which admit a homotopy exponent do not have a homology exponent. 

\medskip
We were able to extend this assertion to spaces with two non-trivial homotopy groups. Our main theorem (Theorem \ref{thm_first_main}) asserts that every $2$-local Postnikov piece with two non-trivial homotopy groups do not have a homology exponent. The same is also true for spaces which satisfy the hypothesis of Theorem \ref{thm_second_main}. 

\medskip
This leads us to the following reasonable conjecture: 

\begin{conj_main}
\input conj_main
\end{conj_main}

Section \ref{section:conjectures} provides a short discussion of this conjecture..

\begin{rem*}
In the present work, we decided to prove all our results for $2$-local H-spaces. Of course, we could have done the same for any odd prime instead of $2$.
