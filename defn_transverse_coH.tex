Let $X$ be a space and $\{B^*_r,d_r\}$ be its mod-$2$ cohomology Bockstein spectral sequence. Let $n$ and $r$ be two positive integers. An element $x\in B^n_r$ is said to be {\bf $\ell$-transverse} if $d_{r+l}x^{2^l}\not=0\in B^{2^l n}_{r+l}$ for all $0\leq l\leq\ell$. An element $x\in B^n_r$ is said to be {\bf $\infty$-transverse}, or simply {\bf transverse}, if it is $\ell$-transverse for all $\ell\geq0$. We will also speak of {\bf transverse implications} of an element $x\in B^n_r$.
